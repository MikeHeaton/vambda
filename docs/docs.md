# VAMBDA
## Code with drawing.

# Introduction

Computer code permeates every part of our society, all the way down to our watches. Programming languages come in many flavours: we have functional and imperative languages; typed languages; object-oriented; languages for data analysis, for the web and for making art. But almost all serious languages have something in common -- they are all _white text on a black screen_. Unexciting. Opaque. Linear.

Enter Vambda, with one question: when our culture has achieved such richness of expression...
>__Why should all our programming languages look the same??__

Vambda is a visual functional programming language. Instead of describing programs using text, we draw programs in the editor using nodes and arrows. Vambda code is beautiful, playful and _fun_. __Organise__ your code. __Colour__ your code. __Draw on__ your code! Vambda is an invitation to think abut programming in a different way.

Unlike other visual programming languages, Vambda is both general-purpose and fully-featured. Vambda programs compile to Scheme, a dialect of Lisp, so Vambda inherits the rich syntax and power of Lisp. The first iterations of the editor and compiler are written in JS, using [Cytoscape JS](http://js.cytoscape.org/ ) and [BiwaScheme](http://www.biwascheme.org/). The environment is fully web-based: there's nothing to install client-side and setting up is a breeze. Tested in Chrome.

Vambda has been my one-man project for the last couple months. As such, it's still very much in the pre-alpha stages. The UI is buggy and unfinished but Vambda __works__ and it's __fun__. Try it out!
