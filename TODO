I THINK the loading problem is to do with order of loading.
Therefore need to load in order: load everything in position first, THEN set the parents for everything once it already exists.
Although this might not solve it, of course, because fml.

  lambda function (no funny business with inheritance) and take all variables
  inside immediate scope to be bound.

  variables not defined in deeper scopes.

Packages:
Elesfn.remove can be found in line ~2500 of cytoscape.js.
The package should /probably/ use
  var elesfn = Element.prototype = Collection.prototype;
and then define/redefine elesfn.foo like in cytoscape.js.
But I'm not exactly sure how packages work, look at another eg.


BUGS
> Comment text (what about drawing?) don't disappear when resetting the page.
> After making comment text, the program is still in comment mode.
> Make comment text and lines bigger.
> Colours have stopped matching existing colours, also string and int colourings.
> What happens to input variables inside defines? Do they pass through to the nearest function scope, or no?
